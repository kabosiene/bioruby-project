My BioRuby bachelor's project

„Some examples of Bioruby applications”

BioRuby – useful package for bioinformatics, based on object oriented programming
language Ruby. I have reviewed and implemented some basic modules and classes for
working with strings, codon tables, colour schemes, databases, modelled protein data (PDB
file) as a graph and protein unfolding path. All shown BioRuby functions are mostly used by
bioinformaticians.


Keywords: BioRuby, sequences, alignment, codon table, databases, protein, graph, protein unfolding
